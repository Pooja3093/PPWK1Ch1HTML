#**Challenge 1 (Week 1 assignment)**




**Challenge Type:** On-the-job ticket
**Task:  Refactoring existing code to make it more accessible.


**User Story:** 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


**Acceptance criteria:**
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


**Modifications done:**
* Non-semantic elements were changed to semantic elements and placed in proper flow.
* HTML structure was written in a manner that even without styling, the code elements will be displayed in proper order.
* Comments have been added in HTML as well as CSS file for better readability of code.
* All the images and icons have alt attributes. As all the images and icons are for aesthetic purpose only, the alt description is brief and not detailed.
* The code was consolidated for better structure.
* All the links were made functional.
* The overall styling of the web page was not changed. The changes in the code will reflect only on accessibility and not on original appearance.
